Parallel fibers are meant not only for tracking current parameters and forming the phase space. They give a more detailed model of coefficients storage in systems of differential equations, which makes it possible for systems to learn during synchronization with the simulated process. This assumption is an alternative to the current synaptic understanding of the neural network learning process. At present, synapses are regarded as the junction between the output of one neuron and the input of another, where the signal is strengthened and weakened. Thanks to signal amplification and attenuation, neural networks are trained. As a result, the output signal will be correct after the input signal has been processed by the neural network.

Fig. 2 shows four representation forms of this model of harmonic oscillations.

Here is a brief description of each of the implementation forms of the model.
1	**Physics (mechanics).** It is a direct physical model, which depends on recognizing key spatial components and frameworks liable for the collection and movement of mechanical energy to them. The presented spring pendulum is a body moving in space and capable of accumulating kinetic energy. Spring is a mechanical part that acts on the body and stores potential energy.
2	**Mathematics.** It is a mathematical representation of a physical system in the form of differential equations system. In our example, it is the second-order differential equation of damped harmonic oscillations. 
3	**Biology (neurobiology, homeostasis, evolution).** It is a cytoarchitectural representation based on cerebellum cells as a structure consisting of neurocomputer elements. Our cell is an eight-neuron, three-layer structure with five granule cells and, as a result, the same number of parallel fibers. It also has three Golgi cells. W. Ross Ashby's homeostat is the closest to understanding the principles of building intelligent systems consisting of encapsulated blocks and being able to adapt to the environment. 
4	**Computer science (computer programming).** Execution of a neurocomputer model in view of the von Neumann architecture using an imperative programming language. The Pyglet module is utilized in this instance to create the Python model. The model enables the development of multimedia applications. The understanding and implementation of the proposed architecture require an interdisciplinary approach, that is, the possession of knowledge in four complex areas, which may be a barrier to its acceptance and widespread application.
